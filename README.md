## Practice Exercises:Intro to APIs [Tutorial]

## Description 
In this project, we create a web application that fetches random user profile data from the Random User Generator API, parses it into JSON, and stores it in an array. We'll use a function expression to dynamically display user profiles, including their country, name, and profile image. Additionally, you'll implement a drop-down list to change the number of profiles displayed, with a change event adjusting the asynchronous function to retrieve 1, 3, or 5 users based on the selected option.
